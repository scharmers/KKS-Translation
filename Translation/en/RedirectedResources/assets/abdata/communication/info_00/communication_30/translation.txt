「えっ？　ここ女子トイレよ？　はい、すぐに出ていこうね」=“Eh? This is the women's toilet, you know? Yes, let's get outta here, fast.”
「……こんな場所にキミがいちゃダメでしょ！？　もしかしてどこかと間違えた？」=“...You know you shouldn't be here, right!? Are you confusing this place with somewhere else?”
「あー、今時間がないの。ごめん、タイミング悪かったね」=“Ah, I don't have time right now. Sorry, you just caught me at a bad time.”
「すぅ……すぅ……んん……今日も頑張る……」=“Haa... haa... nhh... I'll do my best now...”
「こらっ！　こんな格好は見ちゃいけません！」=“C'mon! You shouldn't look at me when I'm dressed like this!”
「水着姿、結構自信あるんだけど……あはは、やっぱり恥ずかしいね」=“I'm pretty confident about how I look in my swimsuit, but... ahaha, it's still pretty embarrassing, after all.”
「付いていくのは構わないけど、どこまで行くのかな？」=“I don't mind following you, but how far we going, exactly?”
「ちょっ、どこに入ろうとしてるの！　ダメよっ！」=“Hey, where are you trying to enter?! You can't!”
「あっ……ふふっ、キミと話せると思うと何だか楽しくなっちゃうな」=“Ah... fufu... just thinking about having a chat with you makes me happy.”
「そういえば……キミって男の子なのよね……あ、ううん、深い意味はないわよ」=“Come to think of it... you really are a boy... hh, no, I didn't mean anything by that.”
「ひゃんっ！　キミいたの！？　もー、びっくりするじゃない」=“Hyan! You were there!? Geez, you startled me.”
「あら、どうしたの？」=“Hey, what's going on?”
「何か用？」=“What's happening?”
「ん、私とお話したいの？」=“Nh, did you want to talk to me?”
「気軽に話せるって大事だよね」=“It's important to be able to talk to each other, isn't it?”
「うんうん、気を使いすぎるのは疲れちゃうしね」=“Yeah, yeah, I'm tired of beating around the bush, you know?”
「でーも、親しき中にも礼儀あり、だからね？」=“But it's just common courtesy to be friendly, you know?”
「何だか時々すっごく年上に感じることがあるよ」=“Sometimes I feel like you're so much older than I am.”
「あはは、実はすっごくすっごく年上なのかもよ？　なーんて」=“Ahaha, well, maybe I am really that much older, okay? Just kidding.”
「もー、女性に対して失礼じゃないかなぁ？　ま、別に嫌じゃないけど」=“Geez, isn't that quite a rude thing to say to a girl? Well, it's not like I really mind.”
「うーん……今は何か別の話しましょうか」=“Mmmm... let's talk about something else now.”
「あー、毎日楽して過ごしたいなぁ……」=“Ah- I wish I could spend all my days just having fun...”
「気持ちはわかるわよ？　でも、かといって楽過ぎてもつまんないのよねー」=“I know how you feel, okay? But on the other hand, if everything came easy, it'd be boring, wouldn't it-?”
「この前、珍しいモノを見つけて……」=“I came across something unusual, the other day...”
「え、なになに？　早く教えてよー」=“Eh, what, what? Hurry up and tell me-”
「恋愛には積極的に行動する方？」=“You someone who actively goes after their love life?”
「そうだねぇ、当たって砕けろってよく言うし、そうなるんじゃないかしら？」=“I guess so. You know what they say: 'You get out what you put into it.' So I guess that's the way I am, you know?”
「ん－、流石に無謀な行動はしたくはないかなぁ」=“Nh- I don't want to do anything reckless.”
「どんな恋愛をしてみたい？」=“What kind of love would you like to share?”
「んー、理想があっても思い通りに行かないのが恋、ってイメージがあるからなぁ……」=“Hmm- Even if you have a perfect picture, love doesn't happen the way you want it to. That's the way I look at it...”
「どんな……って理想はないかな。勝負は時の運、って言うじゃない？」=“That's... I'm not sure I have an ideal. Success kinda falls down to luck, doesn't it?”
「好きな男性のタイプってどんな感じ？」=“What kind of guy is your type?”
「即答で優しい人。優しければあとは気にしないかな」=“To put it simply, a kind person. As long as they're kind, I guess I don't really mind anything else.”
「うーん、タイプって言われても……自分に合う人？　かしら？」=“Hmmm, talking about a type... a person that fits me? I guess?”
「こういう話ってちょっと難しいというか、恥ずかしいというか……別の話題にしましょ？」=“It's kinda hard talking about this stuff... rather, it's embarrassing...  let's talk about something else, okay?”
「コイバナかぁ……うーん、女子と恋愛のことを話すって難しいなぁ」=“Girl talk... hmmm. It's kinda hard to talk about love stuff with girls.”
「うんうん、分かるよ。異性だもんね」=“Yeah, yeah, I totally get you. It's the opposite sex, after all.”
「ねぇ、こんな噂話、聞いたことある？」=“Hey, you ever heard this rumor?”
「なになに？　昼ドラ的な展開？」=“What, what? Some kind of daytime drama development?”
「女の子同士、コイバナ的なものってやっぱり多かったりするの？」=“Think there's lots of girls who tell each other about their love lives?”
「んー、キミが想像してるよりは、かもよ？」=“Hmm- maybe more than you'd imagine, you know?”
「積極的な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about aggressive guys?”
「いいんじゃない？　ぐいぐい引っ張ってくれる人、好きよ」=“I guess they're alright? I like a guy who pulls you along with them. ”
「積極性を強引と履き違えてたら……嫌ね」=“One can easily mistake aggressiveness as coercion, so... I don't like it.”
「慎重な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about cautious guys?”
「物事をしっかり考えてくれそうで……安心できるかも」=“They seem to really think things through... that might make me feel safe.”
「ダメダメ、男の子なら時に大胆に！　時にアグレッシブに！　でしょ？」=“Nope, nope, guys gotta be bold sometimes! Even aggressive! Right?”
「勤勉な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about diligent guys?”
「真面目なのは悪いことじゃないわ。尊敬できるわね」=“It's not a bad thing to be serious and earnest. In my opinion, they're respectable.”
「私がいい加減だからなぁ。あんまり堅苦しいのはちょっと……」=“I'm a bit irresponsible, as you know. Those kinds of people are a bit too stiff for me...”
「マイペースな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of guys who always move at their own pace?”
「周りに流されないのは素敵かも。自分がある！　って感じがするでしょ？」=“It might be nice to be swept away along with them. I'm that way myself! You know all about that, don't you?”
「独りよがりな感じがして苦手ね。空気が読める人の方がいいわ」=“I don't like them. They feel too self-absorbed. I'd rather be with someone who can read the mood.”
「優しい男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about kind and gentle guys?”
「すごくいいわね。優しさって、私にとっては最高のアピールポイントなんだけど……みんなは違うのかしら？」=“They're really nice. Kindness is one of the biggest appeal points for me, but... I guess that might be different for others?”
「優しいだけじゃ物足りないかな。たまには厳しくして欲しいものね」=“Kindness alone isn't enough, in my opinion. I want someone who can get tough at the right times.”
「クールな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about cool guys?”
「冷静沈着、いいわね。そういう人には憧れるわ」=“Being cool, calm and collected sounds great. I really admire those kinds of people.”
「何だか一人で生きていけそうなイメージ。恋愛対象としては難しいかも」=“I have this picture of them being too self-reliant. It might be hard to find them as a love interest.”
「この年頃ってみんなエッチなことに興味あるのかな？」=“I wonder if everyone at our age is interested in sex?”
「おー、さすが男の子。キミはそういうことに興味があるんだね？　ん？　ん？」=“Ah, as expected of a guy. So you have an interest in those sorts of things? Hm? Hm?”
「ここだけの話、私は無きにしも非ずだけど……みんなはどうかしらね」=“Just between you and me, I kinda do... but I wonder about everyone else.”
「エッチの時ってやっぱり男がリードするべきなのかな？」=“When it comes to sex, you think that the guy should take the lead?”
「そうねぇ、やっぱりそれが普通なんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで私の意見よ？」=“Well, yeah, isn't that the norm after all? A-although, that's just my opinion, you know?”
「女子でもぐいぐい行く娘はいるんじゃない？　好みの問題は別として」=“I'm sure there's girls who take charge, you know? Guess it's just a matter of taste.”
「エッチな本とか読んだことある？」=“Have you read any porn magazines or the like?”
「まぁ、多少はね……あ、でもソフトな方だと思うわよ？」=“Well, sort of... ah, but just the softer stuff, you know?”
「興味ないわけじゃないけど、あんまり機会がないかなぁ。でもキミ、女子にそんなこと聞いちゃうわけ？」=“It's not that I'm not interested, but I've never really had the opportunities. But why are you asking a girl a question like that?
「こういうのってもっと仲良くなってから話すこと……よね？」=“That's the kind of thing we should talk about only after we get to know each other better... right?”
「この間観た洋画がさ、すごいベッドシーンで……」=“So this western movie I saw the other day had this amazing bedroom scene...”
「え、それ何て洋画？　私も観てみようかしら……なんちゃって」=“Eh, western movie? Maybe I'll try watching it... just kidding.”
「エッチの時って……どうして女の子は声が出ちゃうのかな」=“When having sex... why do girls let out squeals like that?”
「いや、もうそれ完全にセクハラ発言だし……知ってても答えないわよ？」=“Nope, that's straight up sexual harrassment... and even if I knew, I wouldn't tell you, okay?”
「誰しも、敏感になるところはあるよね……」=“Well, we all have our sensitive spots...”
「あー、そんな事言って私の弱点聞き出そうって思ってるんでしょー？」=“Ah- I know you're just trying to find out my weak spots by asking me that, okay-?”
「うーん……私の顔、どこか変なところでもある？」=“Hmmm... there something wrong with my face?”
「もー、気になっちゃうでしょ。あんまりジロジロ見ちゃダメよ？」=“Geez, I know you're curious. But don't stare at my face like that, okay?”
「ダメだってば。さすがに怒るわよ？」=“I said don't. I'll get mad for real, okay?”
「……んー、どこ見てるのかな？　ん？　ん？」=“...Hmmm, just where you looking? Hmm? Hmm?”
「そういうとこ、じーっと見るの良くないと思うなぁ。本気よ？」=“I don't think it's good for you to stare at me like that. Serious, okay?”
「キミがセクハラ男子になるのを見過ごすわけにはいかないわね。はい、もう禁止！」=“I'm not gonna overlook it when a boy sexually harasses me. Nope, you're banned!”
「……ジロジロ見たって何も変わらないよ」=“You're not gonna change anything by staring at me.”
「えっ……いきなりどうしたの？　私の手、何か気になる？」=“Eh!... What's this all of a sudden? Why the sudden interest in my hand?”
「やんっ……もー、男子に手を握られるのって結構緊張するのよ？」=“Yikes...! Geez, I get nervous when a boy holds my hand, you know?”
「そんなに触っちゃダメ。あんまりやりすぎると気持ち悪いって思っちゃうわよ？」=“Don't touch me so much. You know that if you take things too far, I'll think you're weird, right?”
「ひゃんっ！　う、うそっ……わざとじゃない……わよね？」=“Hyan! N-no way...! That wasn't on purpose... was it?”
「わざと触ってるの！？　こ、こんなことしちゃダメ……って、教えてあげなきゃ分からない？」=“Did you touch me on purpose!? Y-you can't do things like that... wait, why do I even have to explain this to you?”
「もう、分かっててやってるなら質が悪いよ？　いい？　こういうことはいけないことなの！」=“Geez, doing that when you understand what you're doing makes you even worse, you know? Got it? You can't go around doing things like that!”
「あら……頭、何かついてた？」=“Hey... was there something on my head?”
「もう……誰にでも簡単にそういうことしちゃダメ。意外と特別なことなのよ？」=“Geez... You can't go around doing stuff like that to everyone so easily. It's more special than you might think, okay?”
「お互いに誤解されたら困るでしょ？　だからここまで！　ね？」=“You wouldn't want us to misunderstand each other, would you? So, stop that there! Alright?”
「こ、こらっ、いきなりなんてことするのっ！？」=“H-hey, what do you think you're doing, all of a sudden!?”
「人のほっぺた触って喜ぶなんて悪趣味すぎるわよ、もう」=“Getting a kick out of touching someone's cheek is in very poor taste, geez.”
「うーん、さすがの私もイライラしちゃいそうな空気……本気よ？」=“Mmmm, you have to expect that the mood between us is getting me irritated... I'm being serious, okay?”
「……何を考えてるの？」=“...what are you thinking?”
「ちょっとずつキミとの距離が縮まってる気がするわね。私の勘違い……じゃないといいんだけど♪」=“I feel like I'm getting a little bit closer to you. I hope that... I'm not wrong about that♪”
「男子との会話って新鮮ね」=“It's refreshing to have a conversation with a boy.”
「うーん、何か楽しい話はないかしら……」=“Hmmm, I wonder if there's anything fun to talk about...”
「キミって……聞きたい言葉も言ってくれずに放っておくのね」=“You're... just going to leave without saying the words I wanted to hear, huh?”
「……ごめんなさい、もうやめましょう。なんだかイメージと違う会話になっちゃったわね」=“...I'm sorry, let's stop here. Somehow this conversation turned out different from what I was expecting.”
「こういう状態で会話しても楽しくないわよね」=“It's not fun to have a chat in a situation like this.”
「キミと話してるとすごく楽しいわ。また色々話しましょ」=“You're so much fun to talk to. I'm sure we have even more to talk about.”
「キミの話聞いてると……私、興味津々になっちゃう。何にって……それは秘密よ♪」=When I listen to you... I get really curious. In what way...? That's a secret♪”
「今回はここまでにしましょ。またね」=“That's enough for now. See you later.”
「っと、そろそろ行かなくちゃいけないの。またお話しましょ？」=“Oh, I gotta go now. Talk again soon?” 
「続きはまた今度。それじゃまたね」=“To be continued. I'll see you later.”
「ええ、それじゃこれで。キミさえ良ければ、また声かけてね」=“Ehh, I'll leave you to it. Chat me up again if you want to, okay?”
「ふふっ、またね」=“Fufu, see you.”
「ちょっと観光しに行かない？」=“Wanna do a little sightseeing?”
「そうね、私も行ってみようかしら」=“Well, I guess I'll go.”
「あーごめんなさい、また今度さそってもらえるかしら？」=“Ah- I'm sorry, maybe we could go again some other time?”
「よかったら、これから遊ばない？」=“If you'd like, want to go play now?”
「面白そうね、私も付いていくわ」=“Sounds interesting. I'll head out with you.”
「うーん……ごめんね、遠慮しておくわ」=“Mmmm... sorry, I'll pass.”
「ねぇ、一緒に体験コーナーに行ってみない？」=Hey, why don't we head to the experiencing section together?”
「えぇ、いいわよ」=“Ehh, sure.”
「ごめんなさい、ちょっと都合が悪いの……」=“I'm sorry, it's just not a good time...”
「どこか食べに行こうと思うんだけど、一緒にどうかな？」=“I'm thinking of going somewhere to eat. Would you like to join me?”
「そうね、お腹も空いてきたし、行ってみようかしら」=“Well, I am getting hungry, so let's go.”
「残念、あんまりお腹空いてないのよねー」=“I'm not all that hungry, shame-”
「ちょっと付いてきてもらっていい？」=“Can you come with me for a second?”
「ふふっ、どうしたの？」=“Fufu! What's up?”
「ごめん、今は無理なの。ちょっとタイミング悪かったかな」=“Sorry, I can't right now. I guess the timing's a little off.”
「ちょ、ちょっとなに普通に入ってきてるの？　誰かに見つかったら大問題よ？」=“W-wait, what are you doing, just strolling in here? If someone finds you, that'll be a big problem, you know?”
「きゃーっ！　ここは女子トイレ！　キミは使っちゃダメよ！」=“Kyaaa! This is the girl's restroom! You shouldn't be using it!”
「も、もー、私しかいなかったからいいものの……キミ、変なところで度胸あるのね」=“G-geez, it's fine, since I'm the only one here... you sure are bold in strange places...”
「きゃっ！　こんなとこで何してるの！？　って、くつろいでないで早く出なきゃダメよ！」=“Kyaa! What are you doing here!? Just don't settle in... you gotta get out of here, now!”
「あっ、ごめんね、今はちょっと忙しくて……また今度、ね？」=“Ah, sorry, I'm a little busy right now... maybe next time, okay?”
「ひゃあぁっ！　こんな姿見られたっ！　お嫁に行けなくなったら、キミが責任取ってくれるの？　なんちゃって」=“Hyaaa! Being seen like this! If noone will marry me anymore, will you take responsibility? Just kidding.”
「こ、こらっ！　いくら興味があってもそんなにジロジロ見ちゃダメよ！」=“H-Hey! No matter how interested you might be, you can't just stare like that!”
「別に見られるのは嫌じゃないけど……やっぱり恥ずかしいわよね」=“While I don't particularly hate being seen like this... it's still embarrassing, after all.”
「こういう姿を堂々と見るのもスゴイと思うなぁ、お姉さんは」=“Onee-san doesn't know whether to be shocked or amazed at how brazenly you're just staring at her...”
「きちんと付いてきてるわよ」=“I'm right behind you.”
「ちょっと、ちょっと！　どこに入ろうとしてるのっ」=“Wait, wait! Where do you think you're going?”
「時々ね、キミのことすごいなぁって思うよ。尊敬しちゃう」=“Sometimes, I can't help but think how amazing you are. I really respect you.”
「うーん、キミを見てると男女の身体の違いが気になってきちゃうなぁ。あ、え、エッチな話じゃないよ？」=“Mmmm, when I look at you, I can't help but notice how different a man's body is compared to ours. Ah, I-I wasn't talking about anything lewd, okay?”
「きゃんっ！　キミっ、いたの！？　へ、変な声聞かないでよ、もー」=“Kyaa! You were there!? I-I ended up letting out such a weird noise, geez.”
「なになに？　お姉さんに用かな？」=“What what? You need something from this onee-san?”
「どうしたの？　私とお話したくなっちゃった？」=“What's up? Felt like chatting with me?”
「あら、丁度キミの声が聴きたかったの……なーんて」=“Hey, I was just hoping to hear your voice... kidding-”
「時々、お姉ちゃんっぽいって言われない？」=“Do people often tell you that you're like an onee-chan?”
「うんうん、よく言われるわよ。キミもそう感じるなら、これからは私のこと、お姉ちゃんだと思ってみる？」=“Yep, I get told that very often. If you feel the same way, you can think of me as your onee-chan as well, you know?”
「自分ではそう思われたいんだけど……意外と年下扱いされちゃったりするのよね……」=“I feel the same way about myself but... sometimes it's surprising when I'm treated like I'm younger than I am...”
「人間、やっぱり素直が一番だよね」=“It's best when people are honest, isn't it?”
「うんうん、身も心も素直が一番よ」=“Yep yep, it's best to be honest - in body, and soul.”
「ふふっ、どうかしら？　私もいろんな事を秘めてるかもしれないわよ……？」=“Fufu, what's this? I might be holding back all kinds of things, too, you know...?”
「こういう場所に来ると、やっぱりテンション上がるよね」=“When you show up at places like this, it's still pretty exciting, isn't it?”
「そうね、ついついはしゃいじゃうわね」=“That's right, it's all very exciting.”
「でも、あまり羽目を外し過ぎるのはダメよ？」=“But don't get all carried away, alright?”
「この島は、陸・海両方とも魅力的なところが多いよね=“There's so much to love about the island... both the land and sea, isn't there?”
「そうね、こんな綺麗な海を実際に見るのは初めてだったわ」=“That's right. I've never seen such beautiful ocean scenery in person before.”
「えぇ、豊かな自然で彩られている、とてもいい島だと思うわ」=“Ehh, I guess it's a very nice island. It sure does display the abundance of nature.”
「うーん、せっかくだからキミとは違うお話がしたいわね」=“Mmm, I'd really like to talk to you about something different.”
「そういえばこの前ふと見つけたんだけど……」=“Come to think of it, I found something the other day...”
「あぁ、それ私も見たことあるわ、何だったのかしらね……？」=“Ahh, I saw that, too. I wonder what it's all about, you know...?” 
「やっぱり彼氏とか欲しい？」=“So, you still want a boyfriend and stuff?”
「まぁ、そういうお年頃だしね。なに？　キミが立候補してくれたりするの？」=“Well, I am at that age. Why? You gonna announce your candidacy for it?”
「うーん、はっきりイエスと答える自信はないわね。今は勉強も大変だし……」=“Mmmm, I'm not sure I can answer that with a solid 'yes'. It's hard enough to just focus on studying...”
「将来の夢とかってある？」=“Any dreams for the future?”
「それはもちろん、いいお嫁さんになることよ？」=“Well, the first item is being a good wife, you know?”
「んー、将来的な事よりも今目の前の事の方が大事、かな……？」=“Nh- what's in front of me now is more important than the future, I guess...?”
「周りから恋愛事を相談されたとき、どう対処する？」=“How do you deal with it when someone tells you about their live life?”
「そうね、私だったら思いっきり応援してあげたくなるわね」=“Well, if it was me, I'd want to support them with all my heart.”
「んー、あくまでその人の問題だからね、私はそっと背中を押す程度に留めておくわ」=“Nh- that's their problem, so I'd just gently push them away.”
「恋愛系の番組とかって見たりする？」=“You watch romantic shows?”
「ふふっ、ちょっとだけ参考にしてるのは内緒よ？」=“Fufu! Keep it secret that I kinda use them for reference material, okay?”
「あまり見ないかしら？　自分の気持ちが染まってしまいそうで怖いもの」=“Not much, I guess? I'm afraid they'll influence my emotions.”
「待って待って。こういう話はまた別の機会にしましょ」=“Wait, Wait. Let's talk about stuff like this another time.”
「彼女と喧嘩したって愚痴を友達から聞かされてさ……」=“My friend complained about having a fight with his girlfriend...”
「あはは……きっと喧嘩するほど仲が良い、って奴だよ」=“Ahaha... They must have been really close, to be able to quarrel like that.”
「日頃からエッチなこととか考える？」=“You think about lewd stuff on a daily basis?”
「素直に言えばそうだけど……その質問をしたキミがすごいって思うわ」=“To be honest, yes... but I can't help but be amazed that you're asking me that question.”
「考えません！　……本当。本当よ！？」=“Not at all! ...Really. Really, okay!?”
「エッチってさ、男女でするだけじゃないって知ってる？」=“So, you know that when it comes to sex, it's just not about being between a man and a woman?”
「え？　同性とってこと？　……まあ、知ってるわよ」=“Eh? Same-sex stuff? ...well, I knew that.”
「し、知らない知らない。一人でもするなんて知らないんだから！」=“I-I had n-no idea. And I also don't know anything about doing it by yourself!”
「憧れのエッチとかある？」=“Is there a kind of sex you're in to?”
「ふふっ、あるわよ。昔観た映画でね、車の中で激しく……って、素敵だなって思っただけよ？」=“Fufu, there is. I saw it in a movie a long time ago, where they were going at it hard, in a car... er, I just thought it was pretty nice, that's all.”
「特にないわね……そういうシーンを観ても自分に置きかえて考えられないもの」=“There's nothing in particular... even if I saw such a scene in a movie, I don't think I could imagine myself in the same position.”
「エッチな夢とか見ちゃう？」=“Do you get wet dreams?”
「うぅ……たまにあるのよね……顔は分からないんだけど、すごく好きな人に抱き締められる幸せな夢」=“Uuu... Sometimes I do... Although I can't tell who it is from the face, it's always a good dream about me being hugged by the person I love the most.”
「多分ないと思うわ。起きたら忘れてるんですもの」=“Don't think I do. I always forget my dreams after I wake up, anyway.”
「こんな話……いくらキミでもオープンすぎるわ。だからＮＧです」=“This kind of talk... even with you, this is too personal, so it's a no go for me.”
「耳年増な女の子って、どこで知識を得てくるんだろう」=“All those girls who consider themselves experts in sex, I wonder where they get all their information.”
「えっと……やっぱりネットじゃない？　いや、私は耳年増じゃないけどね？」=“Er, um... the Internet, probably? No, I'm not saying that I'm one of those girls though, okay?”
「そんなに見つめてどうしたの？　何か気になる？」=“Why are you staring at me like that? Something bothering you?”
「うーん、男の子の考えることって難しいわね……なにかしら……」=“Mmmm, it's hard to figure out what boys are thinking... wonder what it is...”
「も、もー、分かったわ、私の負け！　恥ずかしいからもう見ないで？　ね？」=“G-geez, I get it, I lose! I'm embarrased, so would you stop staring at me? Alright?”
「あ……キミ今……ふふっ、何でもない。それとも言ってあげた方がキミのためかしら？」=“Ah... just now, you... fufu, it's nothing. Or should I let you know, for your own good?”
「だから気付いてるってば。そういうところは見ちゃダメよ、もう」=“I know what you're doing! Don't stare there so much, geez.”
「キミ、わざとジロジロ見てるでしょう。いい加減にしないと、お姉さん怒っちゃうんだからね」=“You're staring at me on purpose. If you don't cut it out, onee-san will get mad, you know?”
「ジロジロ観察する前にやることがあるんじゃないかしら？」=“Don't you have better things to do than just staring at me like that?”
「きゃっ……ど、どうしたの？　何か付いてた？」=“Kyaa... w-what's going on? Something on there?”
「あんまり気軽に触らないの。女子はデリケートなのよ？」=“Don't touch me so casually. Girls are very delicate, you know?”
「もー、ダメって言ってるでしょう。手を触られるだけで色々考えちゃうんだから！」=“Geez, I said no. Just having my hand touched like that makes me thing of all kinds of stuff!”
「ひゃんっ！　え……な、なに、今何したの？　わざと……じゃないわよね？」=“Hyan! Eh... W-what did you just do? That was... on purpose, right?”
「ひゃぁっ！　わざと触ったの！？　あ、有り得ないと思うんだけど……」=“Hyan! Was that on purpose!? I-I thought that you wouldn't do thta ever, but...”
「はぅっ、さすがにもう触らせないわよ。セクハラなんだからね」=“Hauu, I'm not gonna let you touch me again. This is totally sexual harassment.”
「あら……何かしら？　突然なでなでしたくなったの？」=“Hey... what's up? Had a sudden craving to pat someone's head?”
「むぅ……何だか小さな子みたいな扱い……私のキャラに合わないなぁ」=“Geez... treating me like a little kid... that doesn't really fit my character.”
「恥ずかしいからここまで！　さすがに照れちゃうわ」=“Enough, I'm embarrassed! I'm getting all bashful here.”
「ひゃんっ……むぅ、今、柔らかいとか思ったでしょう？」=“Hyan... Geez, just now, you were thinking that I felt really soft, weren't you?”
「柔らかさを確認しなくていいの！　そんなに強く触ったら跡ついちゃう！」=“You don't have to check how soft I am! Touch me that hard, and you'll leave a mark!”
「こーらー、お姉さんをバカにしてると怖い目に遭わせちゃうわよー！」=“Look here, if you keep making fun of your onee-san, you're gonna scare her away-!”
「キミはもっと空気を読むべきだと思うわ」=“I think you ought to learn how to read the mood a bit more.”
「キミと話してると何でも新鮮。わくわくしちゃうなぁ」=“Everything's new again when I'm chatting with you. You get me so fired up.”
「男の子との会話って楽しいのね。ふふっ」=“It's so fun to talk to a boy. Fufu!”
「誰かとおしゃべりするのってストレス解消にもなるのよ。キミも楽しんでくれてるかしら？」=“Chatting with someone sure works wonders for stress relief. You having fun, too?”
「あら、難しい顔してどうしたのかしら？　何か楽しいお話を考えてくれてるの？」=“Hey, what's up with that serious expression? Trying to come up with something fun to talk about?”
「こういう時に黙っちゃうなんて……はぁぁ」=“I can't believe you're going all quiet at a time like this... *sigh*.”
「今の私、ちょっとイライラしちゃってる。何でだか……分かるわよね？」=“I'm a little on edge at the moment. And I think... you know why, right?”
「もう……全然すっきりしない。じゃあね」=“Geez... that wasn't relaxing at all. See you later.”
「今度またキミとお話出来るのが楽しみよ。色々なこと、聞かせてね」=“I'm looking forward to talking with you again. Tell me all about yourself next time, okay?”
「健全なお話も楽しいけど……次回はもう少しドキドキするお話でも……なーんて。ふふっ、それじゃまたね」=“I enjoy a good, wholesome chat, but... maybe next time we can talk about something a little more exciting... kidding. Fufu! Well, see you around.”
「楽しい時間をありがとう。またお話しましょうね」=“Thanks for the good time. Let's talk again sometime.”
「それじゃ、またキミの声、聞かせて頂戴ね？」=“Well then, I'd like to hear your voice again, okay?”
「あ、もう行かなきゃいけないの……残念だわ」=“Ah, you gotta head out now... that's a shame.”
「ええ、またいつでも声を掛けて。楽しみに待ってるわね」=“Ehh, call for me again at any time. I'll be looking forward to it.”
「ええ、またね」=“Ehh, see you later.”
「俺、[H名]の事が好きなんだ」=“I really like you, [H名].”
「んー、困ったわね……ごめんなさい、返事はちょっと待ってくれるかしら？」=“Nh- I'm troubled... sorry, but you'll have to wait a little before I can react to that, okay?”
「ねぇ、キミの事、好きって言ったら信じてくれる……？」=“Hey, would you believe me if I told you I loved you...?”
「あら、本気にしちゃったかしら？　冗談よ、冗談……」=“Look, I hope you didn't take me seriously, okay? I was kidding, just kidding...”
「あ、あのさ、[H名]とHしたいなって」=“I-I was thinking, I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「え？　冗談でしょ？　うそ、本気……なの？　ごめんなさい、さすがにそれは抵抗あるわね……」=“Eh? You're joking, right? No way, are you... serious? I'm sorry, as expected, I gotta push back on that...”
「[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「もう……キミ、押せば何とかなるって思ってるでしょう？　まぁ、実際負けちゃうんだけど……ふふっ、いいわ、しましょ？」=“Geez... You think I'll eventually say yes if you keep at it for long enough, don't you? Well, I actually do feel like giving in... fufu, sure, let's do it.”
「そういうのは無理よ。身体だけじゃなくて気持ちの問題もあるし……」=“I can't do that. It's not about the physical aspect, but the feelings between us, too...”
「ここで[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you here, [H名].”
「人……いるわよ？　本気？　だったら……付き合うけど♪　そういうプレイ……私も興味あるもの」=“There are... people here though? Really? In that case... I'll go along with you♪ This kind of fetish play... I'm kinda interested in it, too.”
「エッチっていうのは、人がいないところでするものよ？　秘め事っていうでしょう？」=“Isn't sex... something you do when there's nobody around? It's kind of a secret thing, right?”
「うそ、こんなところで？　でも……ふふっ、たまにはそういうスリルもいいかもね」=“No way, in a place like this? But... fufu, sometimes fetish play like this is also fine, I suppose.”
「ここでなんてダメよ。もう、勢い任せなんだから」=“We can't do it here. Geez, I'll leave it to you then.”
「あ、あのねっ……実は私、すっごくエッチに興味があるの！　だから……その……して……くれないかな？」=“Y-you know... In all honesty, I'm actually really interested in sex! So that's why... that is... won't you... do it with me?”
「ありがとう。変な娘だって思われるかもしれないけど……こんなこと、キミにしか頼めなくて……」=“Thank you. You're probably thinking I'm a weird girl... but you're the only one I could ask for something like this...”
「わわっ、そ、そうよね！　ごめんなさい。私、ちょっとどうかしてたみたい……お願い、忘れて？」=“Wah, y-you're right! I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me... please, can you just forget about it?”
「二人で島を観光しない？」=“Why don't the two of us go sightseeing?”
「ええ、キミとならいいわよ？」=“Ehh, I'm happy to go with you, okay?”
「ねぇ、私と一緒に島を歩かない？」=“Hey, why not come walk around the island with me?”
「ふふっ、よかった。　それじゃ早速行きましょ？」=“Fufu, I get it. Well, let's get to it, okay?”
「そう……じゃ、また今度誘うわね」=“So... right, I'll ask you some other time.”
「興味があったら、一緒にカヤックに乗ってみない？」=“If you're interested, why not come kayaking with me?”
「いいわよ？　行ってみましょ？」=“That'd be okay? Then shall we go?”
「残念だけど、また今度誘ってくれるかしら？」=“Sorry to hear that, but maybe I could invite you another time?”
「どうかしら、ちょっと遊んでみない？」=“I don't know... maybe we could go play for a little while?”
「ＯＫ、行きましょ行きましょ」=“OK, let's go, let's go.”
「そっか、残念ね……」=“That's a shame...”
「ねぇ、体験コーナーに行ってみない？」=“Hey, why not head to the experience corner with me?”
「あら面白そうね、行ってみましょ？」=“So, that sounds interesting... shall we go?”
「あー、ちょっと今は……悪いわね」=“Ah- now's a little... too bad.”
「ねぇ、キミと一緒にやってみたい体験があるんだけど、今から大丈夫？」=“Hey, there's this experience I want to try with you... is now alright?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。それじゃあ早速行きましょうか」=“Fufu! Thank you. Well then, wanna hurry on down there?”
「そう、都合が悪いなら仕方ないわね」=So... if it's inconvenient for you, it can't be helped.”
「お腹空いてるなら一緒に食事とかどう？」=“If you're hungry, why don't we eat together?”
「いいわよ、丁度食べたかったのよ」=“Great, I was just wanting to eat.”
「そうね……もう少しお腹が空いたら行ってみようかしら」=“I see... let's go when you're a little more hungry.”
「ちょっとどこかで食べようと思うんだけど、折角ならキミも来ない？」=“I think I'm gonna head out for a little snack... would it be too much hassle to tag along with me?” 
「よし。あーほんとお腹空いたわぁ～……」=“Right. Ah- I'm just starving~...”
「あら、男の子なんだから沢山食べなきゃダメよ？」=“Hey, don't boys gotta eat a lot?”
「付いてきてもらってもいい？」=“Hey, can you come with me?”
「ええ、どうしたの？」=“Ehh, what is it?”
「待って待って。今は無理よ。ちょっと用事があるの」=“Wait, wait. I can't right now. I have something else to do.”
「こんなところに来て何する気？　もう……男の子って本当にエッチなんだから」=“What are you planning to do, bringing me to a place like this? Geez... boys always only think about lewd things.”
「ねぇ、ここが女子トイレだって分かって入ってきたでしょ？　そう言うことしちゃ、めっ、よ？」=“Hey, you came here knowing this is the girl's toilet, right? You know that doing something like that is wrong, yes?”
「も、もうっ……こんなところで男子と一緒だなんて……誰かに見られたら絶対怪しまれるでしょ」=“G-geez... being in a place like this with a boy... if someone saw us, they'll definitely think we're doing something suspicious...”
「キミはこんな場所に興味があるヘンタイさんなのかしら？　ん？」=“Guess you're a pervert, since you're interested in places like this, that right? Hmm?”
「ごめんね……時間がある時に、またゆっくり話しましょう」=“I'm sorry... let's catch up properly when I have some free time.”
「こ、こういうの……改めて見られるのって……恥ずかしいのよ？」=“T-this is... being seen like this... It's really embarrassing, you know?”
「こらこら、そんなにジロジロ見ないの。キミ、軽蔑されちゃうわよ？」=“Hey, hey, don't stare at me like that. I'll start hating you at this rate, you know?”
「え、えっと……どうかしら？　なによ、お姉さんだって緊張くらいするんだから」=“U-um... What is it? Don't stare like that, this onee-san gets nervous easily.”
「へぇ、女子の水着……そんなに興味あるんだ。まったく……男の子ってどうしようもないんだから」=“Huh, so, girls' swimsuits... do interest you. Seriously... boys really can't be helped...”
「何かしら？　二人きりじゃないと話せないことなのよね？」=“What is it? Something we can't talk about unless we're alone?”
「こらこら待ちなさい。そんなとこに入ったら冗談じゃすまなくなるわよ？」=“Hey, hey, hold on. If you go in there, you won't be able to just pass it off as a joke, you know?”
「キミと一緒にいる時の私、自分でも舞い上がっちゃってるなぁって思うわ。恥ずかしい……」=“Whenever I'm with you, I think I get a little carried away. It's so embarrassing...”
「今まで男の子の知り合いって少なかったから……その……色々なとこ、気になっちゃうな」=“I've never been all that close to any male friends until now, so... um... there's lots of things I'm so curious about.”
「ひゃぁんっ！？　あ、キミ……も、もう……ちょっとエッチな声聞かれちゃった♪」=“Hyan!? Ah, it's you... g-geez... you made me let out such a lewd voice♪”
「ふふっ、今日はどんなお話出来るのかしら？　キミとだったら毎回新鮮よ」=“Fufu! what shall we talk about today? If it's with you, no matter what we talk about, it always seems fresh.”
「会いたいと思ったときに来てくれるなんて、やっぱり運命だったかしら？」=“You came just when I wanted to see you... is it fate, after all?”
「あら、どうかしたのかしら？　未来の旦那さん？」=“Hey, I guess something's up? My future husband?”
「疲れた時はどうしてる？」=
「そうね、やっぱり何もせず横になるのが一番かしら？」=“What do you do when you're tired?”
「私は、幸せだった事を思い出しながら心を落ち着かせるかしらね？」=“I guess I just relax, and look back on what made me so happy, you know?”
「わりと夜更かしとかする？」=“Do you stay up late often?”
「するする。夜中のテレビって面白くって……お肌には良くないんだけどね……」=“I do, I do. I really like watching late night shows. Although, I hear it's not good for your skin to stay up late...”
「実は私、夜に弱いの。すぐに眠くなっちゃって……あー、お子様だって思ったでしょう？」=“Actually, I'm rather bad at doing that. I always feel super sleepy at night... ah, you think I'm just like a little kid, don't you?”
「健康には気を使ったりする？」=“You careful about your health?”
「もちろん。キミと会えなくなるのだけは嫌だからね？」=“Of course. I'd hate not being able to be with you, you know?”
「そこまで気にしてはないけど、最低限の事は自然としてる気がするわ」=“I don't focus on it that much... I feel like doing the bare minimum is the natural thing to do.” 
「記念品とかってあったらほしい？」=“Any souvenirs you want?”
「そうね、やっぱり思い出に残るような品があるとより鮮明に思い出せる気がするわ」=“Let's see. I'm thinking that my memories will last longer than anything else.”
「あったら嬉しいかもしれないけど、やっぱり大事なのは気持ちだと思うわ」=“I'd be happy if there were... but it's the feelings that matter.” 
「あ、そういう話題はちょっと……違うこと話そっか」=“Ah, that topic's kinda... let's talk about something else.”
「これ、ここだけの話なんだけどさ……」=“That's just between you and me, though...”
「……なるほど、そんな事があったのね」=“...oh, I see, so that's that's the way it is.”
「あのさ、たまには俺も『お姉さん』って呼んでみていい？」=“Hey, do you mind if I call you "onee-san" sometimes, too?”
「別に構わないけど……キミ、そういうのが好きなの？」=“I don't particularly mind, but... I didn't know you liked that sort of thing.”
「もしかして恋愛に溺れるタイプ？」=“Are you maybe the type to lose your head over things like love?”
「そ、そうよ。悪い？　ふんだ、どうせキミに出会うまでは気付きませんでしたよーだ。もう……大好きっ♪」=“T-that's right. Is that bad? Hmph, it's not like I cared that much about it before I met you anyway. Geez... I love you ♪”
「お姉さんがそういうタイプに見える？　しっかり自立した女性でしょ？　もう」=“Does this onee-san really look like that type of person to you? Don't you actually mean an independent woman instead? Geez.”
「理想のお嫁さん像ってあったりする？」=“Ever picture yourself what an ideal wife is sometimes?”
「それはもう、愛する旦那に最大限に尽くす事が理想的、かしら？」=“I believe the ideal would be me doing my best for my beloved husband, I guess?”
「そうね、お互いにお互いを支え合う夫婦になりたいわね」=“Well, I'd love for us to be a mutually supportive couple.”
「好きでい続ける為にはどういう事が有効的かな？」=“Ever wonder what the best way is to have someone to keep liking you?”
「そうね……どんな事でも許す寛大な心が大事かしら？」=“Let's see... I think it's important to have a forgiving heart, no matter what, right?”
「私だったら、お互いの気持ちをしっかりとぶつけ合う事が大事だと思うわ」=“If it were up to me, I'd say it's important to make sure we're both on the same page.”
「好きだよ」=“I love you.”
「ふふっ、私も好き、愛してるわ」=“Fufu! Me too, I love you.”
「っ……もぉ、不意打ち過ぎよ」=“!... geez, you caught me off.”
「えっと……ちょっと照れちゃった。こういう話はまた今度にしましょう」=“Er, um... I'm getting a bit embarrassed. Let's talk about this some other time.”
「[H名]が彼女で本当に良かった」=“I'm so glad you're my girlfriend, [H名].”
「え……い、いきなり？　私だってキミが彼氏で良かったって思ってるわよ。ふふっ、本当よ？」=“Eh... W-what's this all of a sudden? I'm glad that you're my boyfriend too. Fufu, I'm serious, you know?”
「やっぱり、甘えられる人がいるのは大事だよね」=“It's important to have someone to spoil you, after all.”
「あら、甘えたいと思ってるのはキミだけじゃないのよ……？」=“Hey, you're not the only one who wants to be pampered, you know...?”
「特殊な性癖とかってある？」=“Do you have any particularly peculiar fetishes or anything?”
「えっと……敢えて言うならＢＬ……うそ、ごめんなさい、何でもない！　何でもないったらー！」=“Um... If I have to pick, I suppose BL... that's a lie, I'm sorry, it was nothing! I'm saying that it isn't!”
「そんなこと自分じゃ分かんないわよー。みんな自分のことはノーマルだと思ってるものよ？」=“Something like that, I don't think anyone really knows about themselves. Doesn't everyone think themselves as normal?”
「背中って感じるかな？」=“Do you feel any sensations in your back?”
「ぞくぞくはしちゃうけど……それって感じるってことなの？　あ、なにその目、やらしいんだから」=“I do feel a shiver down it but... Is that what you meant by "feel"? Ah, what's with those lewd eyes?”
「触ると痒くならない？　うそ、私だけ？　やーん、ムードなくてごめんなさい」=“Doesn't it feel itchy when touched? No way, is it just me? Ehh, sorry, I'm not in the mood right now.”
「自分はＭだと思う？」=“Do you think you're an M?”
「うーん、女の子って基本はＭの娘が多いんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで一般論よ？」=“Well, don't you think that generally there are a lot of girls who are masochists? T-that's just a regular guess though.”
「ふふっ、私は間違いなくドＳね。キミのこと、いっぱい苛めたいもの……って、本気で答えたらどうする気なの？」=“Fufu, I am unmistakably a hard S. I really want to tease you all day... if I actually replied with that seriously, what would you do?”
「鏡とかでさ、自分のアソコをじっくり見たことある？」=“Hey, have you ever, by using a mirror or whatever, properly taken a look down there?”
「恥ずかしいこと平気で聞くんだから……その、あるわ。だって、気になったんだもの……」=“You really ask the most embarrassing things so easily... Yes, I've done that. I mean, I was curious...”
「じっくりと見たことは……って、なに真面目に答えてるの、私！」=“I have taken a good... wait, why am I answering this so seriously!?”
「今、恥ずかしい話はちょっと……他のこと話しましょう」=“Talking about such embarrassing things is a bit... let's talk about something else.”
「エッチって……なんだろうね」=“I wonder... what is sex, really?”
「哲学？　よく分からないけど、キミがにやにやしてることだけは分かるわね」=“An interest in philosophy? I don't really get it myself, but I do know that you're grinning from ear-to-ear.”
「この間、道ばたにエッチな道具が落ちてて……」=“The other day, I saw some sex toys on the side of the road...”
「ど、どんな道具かしら……男性用？　女性用？　あっ、ち、違うのよ。ちょっと気になっただけ」=“W-what kind of toys... For men? For women? Ah, i-it's not like that. I was just a bit curious, that's all.”
「ん？　なになに？　どうしたの？」=“Hm? What what? Something going on?”
「もう、そうやってお姉さんを困らせないの。恥ずかしいでしょ」=“Geez, don't make your onee-san worried like that. It's embarrassing.”
「一体何が目的なのかしら？　お姉さん、深読みしちゃうからダメよ？」=“Just what on earth are you intending? Onee-san will start reading too much into things, so don't do that.”
「こら、今絶対エッチなこと考えてたでしょう？　気付かないと思ってるの？」=“Hey, just now, you were definitely thinking about lewd stuff, weren't you? You really think that I'm dense enough to not notice it?”
「男の子ってそんなにおっぱい好きなの？　それともキミが特別？」=“Do boys really love breasts that much? Or is it that you're just unique?”
「やだ、私の彼氏って……もしかしておっぱいと付き合いたい人なのかしら……？」=“No way, is my boyfriend... really the type of person that would go out with a walking pair of tits if he could...?”
「ねぇ、私はキミに謝って欲しいの。単純、簡単、明快、でしょ？」=“Hey, I want you to apologize to me. Simple, quick and uncomplicated, right?”
「わわっ、もうっ……前置きなしでいきなり……ううん、嫌じゃないよ♪」=“W-woah, geez... No beating around the bush, huh?... Nope, I don't hate it ♪”
「何度も握られるのはちょっと……恥ずかしいよ？」=“Being grabbed like this again and again is a bit... embarrassing, you know?”
「何回もにぎにぎしないの！　こういうのはほら……そういう雰囲気の時にやることよ？」=“Don't grab me like that again and again! Things like this... we should only do it in that kind of mood.”
「やんっ……こ、こらっ、いくら恋人でもダメでしょ」=“Hyan... H-hey, cut it out, even if we're lovers, this kind of thing is no good.”
「うそ……キミ、そういうこと平気で出来ちゃう人なのっ……？」=“No way... Are you someone who lets it out that easily?”
「もう……お姉さん、本気で呆れちゃうわよ？　いいの？　これからそういう目で見ちゃうわよ？」=“Geez... This onee-chan will actually get disgusted for real. Are you okay with that? Do you want me to look at you with those kinds of eyes?”
「あ……ふふっ、こういうのは嬉しいかも……」=“Ah... Fufu, this makes me happy...”
「はわっ、な、ナデナデ繰り返されると……甘えたくなっちゃう……」=“Hawa... I-if you keep patting me like that... I'll become spoiled...”
「さすがに恥ずかしいわよ。ほら、私だってもう立派に大人な女性なんだからー！」=“That's really embarrassing. After all, I'm a proper mature woman too-!”
「ひゃんっ……触られちゃっ……た……♪」=“Hyan... I got felt... up... ♪”
「うーん、何が目的なのかしら？　ほっぺたの柔らかさは胸と一緒……じゃないわよね？」=“Hmm, I wonder what your aim is? You're not comparing the softness of my cheeks to my chest... right?”
「もうダメ！　ほっぺた触られる度にキスされるんじゃないかってドキドキするんだからー！」=“Cut it out! I'm getting too excited just wondering if you're going to kiss me everytime you touch my cheeks!”
「そういうことするなら、きちんと仲直りした後じゃないと嫌……かな」=“Unless you're gonna apologize and make up with me, doing something like that is a bit... I don't like it.”
「キミの近くにいればいるほどキミのこと好きになっちゃう。魔法みたいね」=“I've fallen in love with you to the point that just being next to you is enough. It's like magic.”
「キミが男の子だから……なのかな。私、いつも胸がドキドキして……身体、熱くなっちゃうの……」=“I wonder if it's because you're a boy... When I'm with you, my chest always starts pounding... and my body gets hot...”
「キミのこと、全部知りたくなっちゃった。たくさんお話しましょ？」=“I've become even more interested in you, to the point of wanting to know everything about you. Let's talk lots, okay?”
「ふふっ、キミのお顔をじっくり見てもいい時間ね。へぇ……肌綺麗なんだ……」=“Fufu, just gazing at your face is fun as well. Heh... it's so cute...”
「私とは話すこともない……ってことかしら？」=“Is it that... there's nothing to talk about with me?”
「私、ちょっと限界かも……お互いに一度頭を冷やしてみましょう」=“I think I've hit my limit... Let's both take some time to cool off.”
「ね……どうして私がこんな気分なのか……分かってくれる……わよね？　そうじゃなきゃ……ううん、なんでもない。それじゃ」=“Hey... I wonder why I'm feeling like this... you understand... right? If not... No, it's nothing. Then, see you.”
「どうしてかしら？　どんどんキミの傍に近づきたくなっちゃう。私、引き寄せられてるみたい……またお話しましょうね」=“I wonder why it is? For some reason, I keep wanting to get even closer to you... It feels like I'm being pulled in... Let's talk again sometime, alright?”
「あのね……キミといると、私、初めての気持ちになるの……大きな声じゃ言えない気持ちよ？　あはは、それじゃ、またね！」=“Hey, you know... When I'm with you, I feel these feelings that I've never felt before... Feelings that I can't say out loud... Ahaha, then, let's meet again!”
「ふふっ、そろそろ切り上げないといつまでも話しちゃいそうね。また次も楽しみにしてるわね」=“Fufu, if we don't cut it short here, we'll keep talking forever. I'm looking forward to the next time.”
「残念だけどここでお別れ。また話したいな……」=“I'm sorry to say goodbye here. I'd love to talk to you again...”
「ここまでかしらね。また今度、ゆっくり話しましょう？」=“Guess that's all. Can we talk again sometime soon?”
「うん、このままだとずーっと話しちゃいそうだものね。またいつでも声をかけて」=“Yeah, at this rate, we'll end up talking all day. Call for me again sometime.”
「ええ、それじゃ。またね」=“Alright, then, next time. See you later.”
「もう……本当に男の子なんだから……でも……うん、いいわよ♪」=“Geez... boys are always... But... yeah, it's alright ♪”
「うーん……今はちょっと、かな……」=“Mmm... I'm kinda in the middle of something now, I guess...”
「あのね……私、キミとエッチ……したいな……」=“Hey, um... I want to have sex... with you...”
「良かったぁ……だって、こういうこと聞くのってすごく緊張するんですもの」=“I'm so glad... I mean, asking for something like this makes me really nervous.”
「あ……ひどい……女の子に恥をかかせたな。罪な人ー」=“Ah... so heartless... you've made me so embarrassed. What a sinful man.”
「あのさ、俺、ここで[H名]とエッチしたいんだ」=“Hey, listen, I really wanna have sex with you, [H名], right here.”
「こんな場所で……もうヘンタイさんね……って、ふふっ、私もしたいんだけど♪」=“In a place like this... you're such a pervert... Well, fufu, it's not like I don't want to do it either ♪”
「あのね、キミは世間体と欲望のバランスを考えた方がいいわ。こんなとこじゃダーメ」=“Hey, you should think properly about balancing your desires and public decency. Doing it in this sort of place is no good.”
「うそ……万が一人のことがあったら……って、ふふっ、それも楽しそうね。いいわよ、しましょ♪」=“No way... What if someone walks in... Well, fufu, it sounds fun in its own way. Alright, let's do it ♪”
「もう……こういうところは安心して出来ないからダメなの。エッチはゆっくりしっかりするもの、でしょ？」=“Geez... We can't do it in a place like this, I can't relax here. Sex is something we should take our time with and do properly, right?”
「いいわね。私も買い物しようと思ってたの」=“That's good. I was about to go shopping, too.” 
「キミと一緒にお土産を見に行きたいんだけど、どうかしら？」=“I'd like to go with you so look at souvenirs. How about it?”
「よかった、ほら、早速見に行きましょ？」=“Got it. Hey, let's go check them out!” 
「そう、キミと行きたかったんだけどなー……」=“So, I wish you were going with me-...”
「賛成ね。たくさん遊びましょう？」=“You agreed. So, wanna go wear ourselves out?”
「ねぇ、これから二人で遊ばない？」=“Hey, why not come and hang out with me now?”
「ふふっ、キミも遊びたかったのね」=“Fufu! So you wanted to play, too.”
「そっか、無理そうかー……」=“I see. Guess you just can't-...”
「面白そうね。私も体験してみたいわ」=“Sounds fun. I want to do the experiences, too.”
「ねぇ、今から体験コーナーに行かない？」=“Hey, why don't we head to the experience corner now?”
「ふふっ、そう来なくっちゃ♪」=“Fufu! Suspected as much♪”
「あら、行けない理由でもあるのかしら、残念ね……」=“Hey, is there a reason you can't go? Shame...”
「あら、キミってエスパー？　お腹が空いてたから、私も誘おうと思ってたの」=“Hey, you have ESP-? I was hungry, so I thought I'd invite you to join me.”
「キミが美味しく食べる姿、見てみたいなー……？」=“I really want to see you chow down, okay-...?”
「やった、となれば、沢山美味しいもの食べましょ？」=“We're going, so let's eat up all that tasty stuff, okay?”
「ちぇー、残念……」=“Chuh- Shame...”
「この先特になければ……部屋、来ない？」=“If you've got nothing going on... why not come to my room?”
「部屋、ねぇ……ふふっ、いいわよ、行ってあげる」=“Your room, huh... fufu! Sure, I'll go with you.”
「ええ、もちろん。どこでも付いていくわよ」=“Yes, of course. I'll follow you anywhere.”
「あんまりそういう気分じゃないわね」=“I'm really not in that kind of mood right now, to be honest.”
「ええ」「うん」「そう」「いいわ」「そうね」=“Yes / Yeah / Right / Sounds good / Seems so”
